Summary: ![Taiga landing shot](/images/2021-02-22_saas_vs_selfmanaged/taigalanding.png) It's no longer a matter of cloud versus non-cloud. On-demand, flexible and elastic resources are now the norm. What does remain is the question regarding how you operate a platform like Taiga which deals with your organisation's projects and users.

It's no longer a matter of cloud versus non-cloud. On-demand, flexible and elastic resources are now the norm. What does remain is the question regarding **how you operate a platform like Taiga** which deals with your organisation's projects and users.

Many project management tools have gone Software as a Service (SaaS) *only*. This means you are forced to go for the big supported setup provided by the company behind the service. That would be [tree.taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io) option in our case. It's well known that this approach greatly simplifies release upgrades, operational costs, support and maintenance.

Self-managed, on the other hand, means that you actually **run the tool using your own infrastructure, whatever that is**. You download, install and operate the platform and keep an eye on update notifications, security patches, etc. This allows you and your organisation to more easily **tweak the installation**, integrate it with your own authentication system and keep data and projects under your absolute control.

Between 2010 and 2015 there was a clear movement to go full SaaS and companies that would neglect that trend and stay with old-fashioned data-centres **were dismissed as resistant to inevitable change**. But new breakthroughs in container technology and private cloud commoditisation **have made room for quite modern self-managed solutions**, perhaps having the best of both worlds **for some use cases**.

Now, any medium-to-huge organisation is going to think twice **before adding yet another tool to their private cloud ecosystem**. The fact that you *can do it* doesn't mean you *should do it*. Except that **Taiga has two key ingredients that make for a compelling case, open source and core-process focus**.

Taiga is about choice, it has always been about that since we went past the beta stage in early 2016. You can go **self-managed, SaaS or third party self-managed**. So, between pure SaaS and Self-managed, **how to choose?**

#### You should probably choose [SaaS](https://www.taiga.io/trialsignup) if...

- You don't need Taiga to be custom integrated with many other tools and platforms, including private authentication systems.
- You don't want to host and maintain a piece of software that is core to your organisation's productivity and work.
- You are fine with a per-seat pricing model that scales up nicely (Also, Taiga does have a quite nice free Basic tier).

#### You should probably choose [Self-managed](https://resources.taiga.io/30min-setup/) if...

- You consider your data and projects not to be able to be outside your own infrastructure. **Taiga SaaS is European Union hosted**.
- You need more custom integrations apart from Taiga's API / webhooks / live CSVs (also found on Taiga SaaS).
- You plan to roll out multiple Taiga instances based on your organisation's specific needs.
- You prefer a flatter annual fee for your organisation (supported instance) or trying it out on your own (unsupported instance).

The nice thing about Taiga is that it's a great team player. Its [API and other convenient integration capabilities](https://resources.taiga.io/extend/how-to-extend-taiga/) plus the fact that **you can move Taiga projects between Taiga instances** (including Taiga SaaS) allows you to start “simple” at tree.taiga.io and **decide whether to move to your own Taiga instance later on, or start with your own Taiga instance** (with or without support) and, after a while, consider that there's no good reason to maintain it yourself and ask for **a full instance migration to SaaS**.

It would be amazing if more tools like Taiga could provide a [similar degree of flexibility](https://resources.taiga.io/getting-started/). Unfortunately, **we are seeing the opposite trend**. This is not consistent with what we believe is core to agile and lean practices and what **cross-functional teams and diverse organisation backgrounds demand today**.

Whatever option you pick, **we hope you'll enjoy having Taiga as your project management platform**.
